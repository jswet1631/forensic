Fortunately, only a few basic issues in probability theory are essential for understanding statistics at the level covered in this book. These basic issues are covered in this chapter. 4.1 Introduction The introductory section discusses the definitions of probability. This is not as simple as it may seem. The section on basic concepts covers how to compute probabilities in a variety of simple situations. The Gamblers Fallacy Simulation provides an opportunity to explore this fallacy by simulation. The Birthday Demonstration illustrates the probability of finding two or more people with the same birthday. The Binomial Demonstration shows the binomial distribution for different parameters. The section on base rates discusses an important but often-ignored factor in determining probabilities. It also presents Bayes Theorem. The Bayes Theorem Demonstration shows how a tree diagram and Bayes Theorem result in the same answer. Finally, the Monty Hall Demonstration lets you play a game with a very counterintuitive result. 4.2 Another Subsection In what follows we introduce the basics of probability, which quantifies the chance that something occurs. Lets start with a specific situation to serve as an example. Suppose that we have a population of 1000 people, each classified by gender (Female or Male) and blood type (A, AB, B, or O). The number of people of each combination of gender and blood type is shown in the table below. \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c} &amp; \\mathrm{F} &amp; \\mathrm{M}\\\\ \\hline \\mathrm{A} &amp; 175 &amp; 235 \\\\ \\mathrm{AB} &amp; 16 &amp; 24 \\\\ \\mathrm{B} &amp; 37 &amp; 63 \\\\ \\mathrm{O} &amp; 202 &amp; 248 \\\\ \\end{array}\\\\ \\mbox{Gender and blood type counts} \\] Suppose that we select one of the people at random, and note that persons gender and blood type. There are various possibilities for outcomes, such as the person selected is female with Type A blood. The chance that this outcome occurs is called the probability of this outcome. As 175 out of the 1000 people are female of blood type A, the probability of selecting such a person is \\[\\mbox{P(Female and Type A)} = \\frac{175}{1000} = 0.175\\] Here P(Female and Type A) stands for the probability that the person selected is Female and has Type A blood. A sample of other probabilities that come directly from the table are \\[\\begin{array}{rcccl} \\mbox{P(Female and Type O)} &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{202}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.202 \\\\[5pt] \\mbox{P(Male and Type AB)} &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{24}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.024 \\\\[5pt] \\mbox{P(Male and Type A)} &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{235}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.235 \\\\ \\end{array}\\] We also can combine table entries to compute other probabilities. For instance, there are a total of \\(235 + 24 + 63 + 248 = 570\\) males in our population, so \\[ \\mbox{P(Male)} = \\frac{570}{1000} = 0.57 \\] There are a total of \\(16 + 24 = 40\\) people with blood type AB, so \\[ \\mbox{P(Type AB)} = \\frac{40}{1000} = 0.04 \\] 4.2.1 Sample questions here Place some example questions and answers here. 4.3 And vs Or Above we saw that \\(\\mbox{P(Female and Type A)} = 0.175\\). Suppose we we instead would like to know \\(\\mbox{P(Female or Type A)}\\)? That is, we want to know the probability that a randomly selected person is either female or has type A blood. (Note that this group includes those who are both female and have type A blood.) From our table we see that the total number in this group is \\(175+16+37+202+235 = 665\\) so that \\[ \\mbox{P(Female or Type A)} = \\frac{665}{1000} = 0.665 \\] Other combinations are also possible. For instance, there are \\(175 + 235 = 310\\) people with type A blood and \\(37 + 63 = 100\\) people with type B blood, so there are a total of \\(310 + 100 = 410\\) people that have either type A or type B blood. Therefore we have \\[ \\mbox{P(Type A or Type B)} = \\frac{410}{1000} = 0.41 \\] 4.3.1 Sample questions here Place some example questions and answers here. 4.4 Conditional Probability Now suppose that we just focus on the females in the population, which forms a subset of the population. The probability that a randomly selected female has blood type O is an example of a conditional probability. There are 430 females in the population, and 202 of those have type O blood. Hence the probability that female chosen at random has type O blood is \\[ \\mbox{P(Type O | Female)} = \\frac{202}{430} = 0.470 \\] The notation \\(\\mbox{P(Type O | Female)}\\) is read out loud as The probability of blood type O, given the individual is female. Conditional probabilities arise all the time when evaluating forensic evidence. Other examples of conditional probabilities: The probability of Type AB, given that the person is male: \\[ \\mbox{Pr(Type AB | Male)} = \\frac{24}{570} = 0.042 \\] The probability the person is female, given Type B blood: \\[ \\mbox{Pr(Female | Type B)} = \\frac{37}{100} = 0.37 \\] The probability the person is male, given Type A blood: \\[ \\mbox{Pr(Male | Type A)} = \\frac{235}{410} = 0.573 \\] 4.4.1 Sample questions here Place some example questions and answers here.
