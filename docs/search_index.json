It is NOT intended for circulation. This book introduces statistical methods that are of use in forensic science. In some cases the methods are currently used. In others the methods are described but not generally in use, although we hope that eventually they will be! We assume that the reader has a basic understanding of mathematics, but no prior knowledge of statistics is required. We will provide a modest description of forensic methods, but as many of these are highly nuanced we do not attempt to provide a deep treatment of forensic methods here. However, when possible we will try to provide references to more information. Portions of this book that borrow from the treatment of statistics given in the online materials: Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University This site provides a comprehensive introduction to statistics and is an excellent resource for additional information. We deeply appreciate their willingness to allow the use of their work. 1.1 An Introductory Example Consider the following scenario: Suppose there is a late-night break-in at a closed convenience store. No one is present to see the perpetrator, but there is low-quality CCTV footage. Unfortunately, the only thing that can be discerned from the video is the color of the perpetrators hair. Now consider two possible versions of what comes next: Version 1: The video shows that the perpetrator has brown hair. The day after the robbery, police see a person with brown hair walking down the street. The person is arrested on suspicion of committing the break-in. Version 2: The video shows that the perpetrator has green hair. The day after the robbery, police see a person with green hair walking down the street. The person is arrested on suspicion of committing the break-in. For the sake of this simplified example, in both versions we assume that the color of the hair is the only reason the police suspect the person who is arrested. Question: In which version do you think it is more likely that the police have arrested the person who committed the break-in? Answering the question requires considering the likelihood that the police have the correct person in both versions and deciding which is greater. In most communities people with brown hair outnumber people with green hair, so lets assume that is the case here. Intuitively, it seems reasonable to expect that the likelihood of a correct arrest in Version 2 is greater than that in Version 1: Brown-haired people are relatively common, so in Version 1 the likelihood of arresting the correct brown-haired person is probably low. On the other hand, green-haired people are relatively rare, so in Version 2 the likelihood of arresting the correct person is higher than in Version 1. While the above discussion might be interesting, the word likelihood is imprecise. Our goal in this book is to develop mathematical tools that allows us to quantify the notion of likelihood. This will allow us to specify (for instance) how much more likely a correct arrest is in Version 1 than in Version 2. We take this up in the next chapter. 1.2 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) "],["introduction-to-probability.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to Probability 2.1 Frequency Tables 2.2 The Previous Example 2.3 Exercises", " Chapter 2 Introduction to Probability hide { background-color: #d6d6d6; color: #d6d6d6; } hide:hover { background-color: white; color: black; } 2.1 Frequency Tables The example from the previous section involves the likelihood of arresting the correct person based on their hair color. Here we begin the development of probability which allows us to quantify the notion of likelihood. Lets start by providing some additional context for our example: Suppose that the crime described takes place on an island of 1000 people. The number of these people with each hair color is given in the table below, called a frequency table. Table 2.1: Hair Color Counts Color Count Brown 670 Blond 200 Red 110 Green 20 A probability is a number between 0 and 1 that provides a measure of the likelihood that something occurs, with a larger number indicating greater likelihood. Suppose that we select a person from this population at random. To compute the probability that this person has brown hair, we take the number with brown hair and divide by the number of people: \\[\\mbox{P(Brown hair)} = \\frac{670}{1000} = 0.67\\] We use P() to denote the probability of something. For instance in this case \\(\\mbox{P(Brown hair)}\\) = probability of brown hair. 2.1.1 Sample Questions Sprinkled thought this book are Sample Questions, which also play the role of examples. In the online version, the solutions to these questions are hidden. Before looking at the solution (by hovering), we recommend that you try to do them yourself! 1. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has blond hair? Answer: \\(P(\\text{Blond}) = \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.20\\). 2. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has red hair? Answer: \\(P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{110}{1000} = 0.11\\). 2.2 The Previous Example The above examples are fine but they do not address the question from the previous section. In Version 1, we have a brown-haired person on the CCTV and one of the 670 brown-haired people randomly arrested. Thus the probability that the correct person is arrested is \\[\\mbox{P(correct arrest)} = \\frac{1}{670} = 0.00149\\] In Version 2 of the example we have a green-haired person on CCTV. There are only 20 such people so this time the probability that the correct person is arrested is \\[\\mbox{P(correct arrest)} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05\\] We see that the probability of arresting the correct person if the suspect has green hair is greater than the probability of a correct arrest if the suspect has brown hair. To measure how much greater, we divide the two probabilities \\[\\frac{0.05}{0.00149} = 33.5\\] Thus we see that a correct arrest in Version 2 is 33.5 times as likely as in Version 1. However, even in Version 2 there is only a 0.05 probability that the police have the correct person, so randomly arresting people based only on hair color is not likely to produce the correct outcome in either case! 2.2.1 Sample Questions 1. Suppose CCTV shows a red-haired person committed the robbery, and that a random red-haired person is arrested. What is the probability of a correct arrest in this instance? Answer: \\(P(\\text{correct arrest}) = \\frac{1}{110} = 0.00909\\). 2. Determine the number of times greater the likelihood of a correct arrest if the culprit has red hair vs having blond hair. Answer: In the case of a blond-haired person, we have \\(P(\\text{correct arrest}) = \\frac{1}{200} = 0.005\\). Therefore the ratio of probabilities is \\(\\frac{0.00909}{0.005} = 1.81818\\) so a correct arrest for a red-haired culprit is 1.81818 times as likely as for a blond-haired culprit. 2.3 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) "],["joint-probability.html", "Chapter 3 Joint Probability 3.1 Blood Types 3.2 And vs Or 3.3 Probability Tables 3.4 Exercises", " Chapter 3 Joint Probability 3.1 Blood Types Blood plays a role in many forensic science applications, with the blood type determined by a combination of two different blood group systems: Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. As of 2019, a total of 41 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The two most important blood group systems are ABO and Rh; they determine someones blood type (A, B, AB, and O, with +,  or null denoting RhD status) for suitability in blood transfusion.1 Suppose that we have a collection of 1000 people, with each classified based on both ABO (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh (\\(+\\) or \\(-\\)). The number of people of each combination of ABO and Rh class (the blood type) is shown in the table below.2 Table 3.1: Frequencies by ABO and Rh Groups Group \\(+\\) \\(-\\) A 360 60 B 76 14 AB 25 5 O 390 70 Suppose that one of these people is selected at random and note that persons groups. There are various possibilities for outcomes, such as the person selected has ABO group O and Rh group \\(+\\). The likelihood that this combination occurs is the joint probability of the two classifications, ABO and Rh groupings. There are 390 out of the 1000 people are O and \\(+\\), so the probability of randomly selecting such a person is \\[\\text{P(O and +)} = \\frac{390}{1000} = 0.39\\] Here P(O and \\(+\\)) stands for the probability that the person selected is ABO group O and Rh group \\(+\\). A sample of other probabilities that come from the table are \\[\\begin{array}{rcccl} \\text{P(AB and }-) &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{5}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.005 \\\\[5pt] \\text{P(B and +)} &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{76}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.076 \\\\[5pt] \\text{P(B and }-) &amp; = &amp; {\\displaystyle\\frac{14}{1000}} &amp; = &amp; 0.014 \\\\ \\end{array}\\] We also can combine table entries to compute other probabilities. For instance, there are a total of \\(76 + 14 = 90\\) people with blood group B, so the probability of randomly selecting a person with blood group B is \\[ \\mbox{P(B)} = \\frac{76+14}{1000} = \\frac{90}{1000} = 0.09 \\] As another example, the number of people with Rh group \\(+\\) is \\(360 + 76 + 25 + 390 = 851\\). Thus the probability of randomly selecting a person with Rh group \\(+\\) is \\[ \\mbox{P(+)} = \\frac{360 + 76 + 25 + 390}{1000} = \\frac{851}{1000} = 0.851 \\] 3.1.1 Sample Questions hide { background-color: #d6d6d6; color: #d6d6d6; } hide:hover { background-color: white; color: black; } 1. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has blood groups A and \\(-\\). Answer: \\(\\text{P(A and }-) = \\frac{60}{1000} = 0.06\\). 2. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group AB. Answer: There are \\(25 + 5 = 30\\) people that have ABO group AB, so that \\(\\mbox{P(AB)} = \\frac{30}{1000} = 0.03\\). 3. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group A and ABO group B and Rh group \\(+\\). Answer: The is no person that has ABO group A and ABO group B, so \\(P(\\text{A and O and +}) = \\frac{0}{1000} = 0\\). 3.2 And vs Or Above we saw that \\(\\text{P(B and }+) = 0.076\\). Suppose we instead would like to know \\(\\text{P(B or }+)\\)? That is, we want to know the probability that a randomly selected person is either ABO group B or Rh group \\(+\\). Note that this includes those people who are both ABO group B and Rh group \\(+\\). From our table we see that the total number of people satisfying one or both conditions is \\(360 + 76 + 24 + 390 + 14 = 864\\) so that \\[ \\underbrace{(14)}_\\text{ABO group B} \\hspace{-.15in}+ \\hspace{.05in}\\underbrace{(360 + 25 + 390)}_\\text{Rh group +} + \\underbrace{(76)}_\\text{Both}= 864 \\] The corresponding probability is \\[ \\text{P(B or +)} = \\frac{864}{1000} = 0.864 \\] Other combinations are possible. For instance, the number of people with ABO group A blood or ABO group B blood is \\[ \\underbrace{(360 + 60)}_\\text{ABO group A} + \\underbrace{(76 + 14)}_\\text{ABO group B} = 510 \\] Therefore we have \\[ \\mbox{P(A or B)} = \\frac{510}{1000} = 0.51 \\] 3.2.1 Sample Questions 1. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group AB or Rh group \\(-\\) blood. Answer: The number of people who have ABO group AB or Rh group \\(-\\) is \\(25 + 5 + 60 + 14 + 70 = 174\\) so that \\(\\text{P(AB or }-) = \\frac{174}{1000} = 0.174\\) 2. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group O or Rh group \\(+\\) blood. Answer: The number of people who have ABO group O or Rh group \\(+\\) is \\(390 + 70 + 360 + 76 + 25 = 921\\) so that \\(\\text{P(O or }+) = \\frac{921}{1000} = 0.921\\) 3. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group AB or O. Answer: The number of people who have ABO group AB or ABO group O is \\(25 + 5 + 390 + 70 = 490\\) so that \\(\\text{P(AB or O)} = \\frac{490}{1000} = 0.49\\) 4. Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group A or AB, and also Rh group \\(-\\). Answer: We have \\(\\text{(A or AB) and }(-) = (\\text{A and }-) \\text{ or } (\\text{AB and }-)\\). The number of people who are \\((\\text{A and }-)\\) is 60, and the number of people who are \\((\\text{AB and }-)\\) is 5, so that \\(P(\\text{(A or AB) and }(-)) = \\frac{60+5}{1000} = 0.065\\). 3.3 Probability Tables Frequently, tables provide probabilities (or percentages) instead of counts. To make the conversion from counts to probabilities, all we do is divide each table entry by the total. Thus for our table of blood type counts above, we divide each entry by 1000 to arrive at Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Probabilities by ABO and Rh Groups Group \\(+\\) \\(-\\) A 0.360 0.060 B 0.076 0.014 AB 0.025 0.005 O 0.390 0.070 Table 3.2 entries give the probability of selecting each blood type (determined by the combination of ABO and Rh). For instance, \\[ \\mbox{P(B}-) = 0.014 \\] We can add entries in Table 3.2 to compute other probabilities. For example, suppose we want to compute the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group O blood. Based on the table, this can happen if a person is either O\\(+\\) or O\\(-\\). Because these two groups are disjoint, we can add the probabilities to arrive at \\[ \\mbox{P(O}) = \\mbox{P(O}+) + \\mbox{P(O}-) = 0.390 + 0.070 = 0.460 \\] If instead (for instance) we want to compute P(\\(+\\)), then we add the entries in the corresponding column, giving us \\[ \\mbox{Pr(+}) = 0.360 + 0.076 + 0.025 + 0.390 = 0.851 \\] Note that this matches what we saw earlier. 3.4 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) Blood type - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type This table is based on the distribution of blood types in Canada, reported at https://www.blood.ca/en/blood/donating-blood/whats-my-blood-type "],["conditional-probability.html", "Chapter 4 Conditional Probability 4.1 Restricting the Population 4.2 Conditional Probability 4.3 Exercises", " Chapter 4 Conditional Probability 4.1 Restricting the Population Lets continue with the blood type example from the preceding sections. For convenience the frequency table is included again below. Table 4.1: Frequencies by ABO and Rh Groups Group \\(+\\) \\(-\\) A 360 60 B 76 14 AB 25 5 O 390 70 Now suppose that we focus only on those in our the population that have Rh group \\(-\\).

Table 4.2: Frequencies by ABO group among those in Rh\\(-\\) group Group \\(-\\) A 60 B 14 AB 5 O 70 There is no reason why we cannot compute probabilities based on this one column of data, provided we specify that is what we are doing. This is an example of conditional probability. 4.2 Conditional Probability Lets compute a probability based on the data in Table 4.2. For instance, suppose that a person from the Rh \\(-\\) group is selected at random. The probability that this person has ABO group A is an example of a conditional probability. There are a total of 149 people in the Rh group \\(-\\), with 60 of those having ABO group A. Therefore the probability that an Rh group \\(-\\) person selected at random is ABO group A is \\[ \\mbox{P(ABO group A | Rh group }-) = \\frac{60}{149} = 0.403 \\] The vertical bar in the notation means given that so that \\(\\mbox{P(ABO group A | Rh group }-)\\) is read as \\[ \\mbox{The probability of ABO group A, given that the person is Rh group }-. \\] Note that we can abbreviate the notation to \\(\\mbox{P(A | }-)\\) for compactness in cases where the brevity is not confusing. Conditional probabilities arise all the time when evaluating forensic evidence. (In fact almost all probabilities encountered are conditional.) For another example, suppose that we want to determine the probability that someone is Rh \\(+\\) given that they are ABO group AB. The notation for this is P(\\(+\\) | AB). Referring back to Table 1, we see that there are \\(25 + 5 = 30\\) people who are ABO group AB, and among those there are 25 who are Rh \\(+\\). Thus we have \\[ \\mbox{P(}+\\mbox{ | AB)} = \\frac{25}{30} = 0.833 \\] 4.2.1 Sample Questions hide { background-color: #d6d6d6; color: #d6d6d6; } hide:hover { background-color: white; color: black; } 1.

The numerator 60 came from the number of Rh \\(-\\) people who are also ABO group A, and the denominator 149 is the total number of Rh \\(-\\) people. If we divide the numerator and denominator by 1000, then the quotient is not changed so that we have \\[ \\mbox{P(A | }-) = \\frac{60/1000}{149/1000} = \\frac{0.060}{0.149} = \\frac{\\mbox{P(A and }-)}{\\mbox{P(}-)} \\] This illustrates a general property of probability: If X and Y represent possible outcomes from a random event, then the probability of X given Y is \\[ \\mbox{P(X | Y)} = \\frac{\\mbox{P(X and Y)}}{\\mbox{P(Y)}} \\] Multiplying on both sides of the above equation by P(Y) gives \\[ \\mbox{P(X and Y)} = \\mbox{P(X | Y)}\\mbox{P(Y)} \\] This is called the multiplication rule, and it allows us to move back and forth between joint probabilities and conditional probabilities.

Intuitively, one could claim that 183 people in the group would imply that the probability is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), since \\(\\frac{183}{365} = 0.501\\). However, intuition does not correctly solve this problem. To begin, there are some assumptions that need to be made. For simplicity, we will ignore leap years and assume that all 365 birthdays have an equal probability of occurring. We want to compute \\(P(\\beta)\\), the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday. Recall from the previous chapter that \\(P(\\beta) = 1 - P(\\beta&#39;)\\). In this case, it is much simpler to calculate the probability that no one in the group shares the same birthday with someone else. Lets start with the simple example involving only two people. The probability that they do not share the same birthday is \\[P(\\beta&#39;) = \\left( \\frac{365}{365} \\right) \\left( \\frac{364}{365} \\right) = 0.997\\] \\[1 - P(\\beta&#39;) = 0.003\\] Extending this result to a group of five people: \\[P(\\beta&#39;) = \\left( \\frac{365}{365} \\right) \\left( \\frac{364}{365} \\right) \\left( \\frac{363}{365} \\right) \\left( \\frac{362}{365} \\right) \\left( \\frac{361}{365} \\right)\\] \\[ = \\frac{365!}{365^5(365 - 5)!} = 0.973\\] \\[1 - P(\\beta&#39;) = 0.027\\] This formula can be applied to any number of group size, so that in the general case of \\(n\\) people, the probability that at least two share the same birthday is \\[P(\\beta) = 1 - \\frac{365!}{365^n(365 - n)!}\\] Finally, to solve the original question: how many people are needed in a classroom so that the probability of them sharing a birthday is at least \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)? Iteratively increasing the group size from five, it is clear to see that at a group size of 23, \\(P(\\beta) &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\\) \\[P(\\beta) = 1 - P(\\beta&#39;) = 1 - \\frac{365!}{365^{23}(365 - 23)!} = 0.507\\] Figure 7.1: Probability of Sharing the Same Birthday Figure 7.1 shows the probability increasing while the number of people in a room increases from one to sixty.

Lane, Rice University 8.1 Introduction Suppose that we have a community of 500 people. Each is classified based on their ABO blood group, which is one of A, B, AB, or O. Below we consider graphical methods for displaying the results of the blood group classifications. This starts with tables, and then continues on to how to graph data that fall into a small number of categories. This is an example of qualitative data (also known as categorical data). One characteristic of such data is that the different values do not come with any pre-established ordering. This can be contrasted with quantitative data, such as the weight of a bag of an unknown substance, which does have a natural ordering with respect to different weights. (Another way to think about the distinction: it makes sense to compute the average of quantitative data but usually it does not for qualitative data.) 8.2 Frequency Tables All of the graphical methods shown in this section are derived from frequency tables. Table 8.1 shows a frequency table for the results of the ABO blood group classification. It also shows the relative frequencies, which are the proportion classified in each category. For example, the relative frequency for group B is 45/500 = 0.09. Table 8.1: Frequency Table for ABO Group Data ABO Group Frequency Relative Frequency A 210 0.42 B 45 0.09 AB 15 0.03 O 230 0.46 8.3 Pie Charts The pie chart in Figure 8.1 depicts the ABO group data. In a pie chart, each category is represented by a slice of the pie. The area of the slice is proportional to the percentage of items in the category  that is, the relative frequency multiplied by 100. Figure 8.1: Relative Frequencies for ABO Blood Groups Pie charts are effective for displaying the relative frequencies of a small number of categories. They are not recommended, however, when you have a large number of categories. Pie charts can also be confusing when they are used to compare the outcomes of two different surveys or experiments. In an influential book on the use of graphs, Edward Tufte asserted, The only worse design than a pie chart is several of them. 8.4 Bar Charts Bar charts can also be used to represent frequencies of different categories. A bar chart of the ABO frequencies is shown in Figure 8.2. Frequencies are shown on the Y-axis and the blood group is shown on the X-axis. Figure 8.2: Frequencies for ABO Blood Groups The Y-axis also can show the percentage of observations instead of the number of observations, as in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.3: Percentages for ABO Blood Groups 8.5 Comparing Distributions Often we need to compare different sets of data, or different subsets within the same overall data set In this case, we are comparing the distributions of outcomes or responses. Bar charts are often excellent for illustrating differences between two distributions. Table 8.2 shows the distribution (in percentages) of ABO blood groups for those in Albania and Australia. Table 8.2: ABO Blood Group Percentages ABO Group Albania Australia A 36.7 38 B 17.1 10 AB 6.1 3 O 40.1 49 From Table 8.2 we see that ABO groups B and AB are more common in Albania, group O is more common in Australia, and group A is similar for both. This can be seen in the bar chart in Figure 8.4. Figure 8.4: Percentages for ABO Blood Groups by Country The bars in Figure 8.4 are oriented horizontally rather than vertically. The horizontal format is useful when you have many categories because there is more room for the category labels. 8.6 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) 8.7 Code Appendix library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(tidyr) data &lt;- data.frame(ABO_Group = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;O&quot;), value = c(210, 45, 15, 230)) %&gt;% mutate(prop = value / sum(value) * 100) # Figure 7.1 ----- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y = prop, fill = ABO_Group)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, width = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + coord_polar(&quot;y&quot;, start = 0) + theme_void() # Figure 7.2 ----- ggplot(data, aes(ABO_Group, value)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;ABO Group&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) # Figure 7.3 ----- ggplot(data, aes(ABO_Group, prop)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;#B4464B&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;ABO Group&quot;, y = &quot;Percentage&quot;) # Figure 7.4 ----- data &lt;- data.frame(ABO_Group = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;O&quot;), Albania = c(36.7, 17.1, 6.1, 40.1), Australia = c(38, 10, 3, 49)) %&gt;% pivot_longer(!ABO_Group, names_to = &quot;Country&quot;, values_to = &quot;Percentage&quot;) ggplot(data, aes(ABO_Group, Percentage, fill = Country)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;, width = 0.8) + labs(x = &quot;ABO Group&quot;) coord_flip() "],["graphing-distributions-histograms.html", "Chapter 9 Graphing Distributions: Histograms 9.1 Introduction 9.2 Frequency Tables 9.3 Histograms 9.4 Bin Widths 9.5 Exercises 9.6 Code Appendix", " Chapter 9 Graphing Distributions: Histograms Note: Portions below draw on content from Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University 9.1 Introduction The distribution of a set of data consists of the set of possible data values and the frequency that the values occur. Understanding how data is distributed is a critical component of statistics and data analysis. Visualizing data is an effective way to better understand the distribution and there are a variety of visualization methods available. A histogram is one graphical method for displaying the shape of a distribution of quantitative data. It is useful when there are a large number of data values, providing information about the number of values in different groupings. Histograms are widely used and are fairly easy to produce with software. 9.2 Frequency Tables We begin with an example consisting of the weights of 371 bags containing a substance suspected of being narcotics. The weights of the bags range from 215 to 270 grams. Below are the weights for 10 random bags. (There are too many values for it to be practical or useful to show them all.) ## [1] 240.91 234.66 246.84 244.24 253.39 245.07 228.75 237.29 255.69 254.64 One way to get a sense of the distribution of the weights is through the use of a frequency table, where we organize the data into groups of similar weights and give the count the number in each group. The results for this data set are shown in Table 9.1. Table 9.1: Grouped Frequency Distribution of Weights Interval Lower Limit Interval Upper Limit Class Frequency 215 220 4 220 225 8 225 230 31 230 235 74 235 240 88 240 245 75 245 250 57 250 255 25 255 260 8 260 265 1 To create this table, the range of weights was broken into class intervals. The first interval is from 215 to 220, the second from 220 to 225, and so on. Next the number of weights falling into each interval was counted to obtain the class frequencies. There are four weights in the first interval, eight in the second, and so on. Class intervals of width 5 provide enough detail about the distribution without making the graph too choppy. How one goes about choosing the widths (called bin widths) of class intervals is discussed later in this section. 9.3 Histograms In a histogram the class frequencies are represented by bars with the height of each bar corresponds to its class frequency, providing a graphical depiction of the data. The height of each bar corresponds to its class frequency. A histogram of the weight data is shown in Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1: Histogram of Weights We can see from the histogram that most of the weights are between 230 and 250 grams, with fewer weights in the extremes. We can also see that the distribution is not quite symmetric, with the weights extending farther to the right than to the left. This distribution can be said to be skewed. Because the weights are measured to two decimal places, it is not likely that we get many fence-sitters  that is, values that land right on the border between two bins. This allows us to choose whole numbers as boundaries, avoiding a cluttered appearance. Computer software generally will use this option when feasible, and sometimes automatically labels the middle of each interval instead of the endpoints. (Software typically allows for the user to specify bins if desired.) Histograms can be based on relative frequencies instead of actual frequencies, showing the proportion (or percentage) of values in each interval instead of the exact frequency. Our weight data is displayed as percentages in Figure 9.2. To get the percentages, we divide each frequency by the number of data values (that gives the proportion) and then multiply by 100 to convert to percentages. Figure 9.2: Histogram of Weights We see that the shape of the histogram is unchanged, only the Y-axis is different. 9.4 Bin Widths The choice of bin width determines the number of class intervals. This decision, along with the choice of starting point for the first interval, affects the shape of the histogram. In Figure 9.3 we see histograms for our data using bins of width 1 (left) and width 10 (right). These both give a general sense of the distribution, but here bins of width 1 produce a graph that is too busy while bins of width 10 produce a graph that lacks detail. Figure 9.3: Histograms with Different Bin Widths Most software has defaults for bin widths that might work well for a given set of data, or might not. There are some rules of thumb that can help guide the choice of bin width but these are just guidelines that should not be regarded as definitive, so do not feel bound to them. That said, here are a couple of general guidelines you can consider: \\(\\bullet\\) Sturges rule is to set the number of intervals as close as possible to \\(1 + \\log_2(N)\\), where \\(\\log_2(N)\\) is the base 2 log of the number of observations \\(N\\). For our data set of \\(N = 371\\), we have \\(1 + \\log_2(N) \\approx 9.535\\), suggesting 10 intervals which happens to match our choice. \\(\\bullet\\) The Rice rule suggests that the number of intervals should be the integer nearest to \\(2\\sqrt[3]{N},\\) twice the cube root of the number of data values. For \\(N = 371\\) this formula gives \\(2\\sqrt[3]{371} \\approx 14.371\\), which is somewhat more than we chose. The above rules are just a guide. You are advised to experiment with different numbers of intervals and choose the histogram that you feel best conveys the shape of the distribution. 9.5 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) 9.6 Code Appendix set.seed(4) data01 &lt;- rnorm(371, mean = 239, sd = 8) data01 &lt;- data.frame(Weights = ifelse(data01 &gt; 239, 239 + 1.1 * (data01 - 239), data01)) # Figure 8.1 ----- data01 %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = Weights), breaks = seq(215, 265, by = 5), fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) # Figure 8.2 ----- data01 %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = Weights, y = 100 * ..count.. / sum(count)), breaks = seq(215, 265, by = 5), fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(y = &quot;Percentage&quot;) # Figure 8.3 ----- data01 %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = Weights), binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) data01 %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = Weights), binwidth = 10, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) "],["graphing-distributions-box-plots.html", "Chapter 10 Graphing Distributions: Box Plots 10.1 Basic box plots 10.2 Variations on box plots 10.3 Exercises 10.4 Code Appendix", " Chapter 10 Graphing Distributions: Box Plots Note: Portions below modeled after content from Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University 10.1 Basic box plots In this chapter we discuss the box plot which provides a useful way to graphically display information about the distribution of a set of data, identify outliers, and compare distributions. To get us started, suppose that we have small pieces of glass from two different sources: a broken window at the scene of a burglary and the trunk of a car belonging to a suspect. To compare the glass from the two sources, a trace element present in glass can be measured. The amount present varies within a sheet of glass so measurements are taken from numerous pieces found at the crime scene and in the car trunk. (The specifics of the element and measurement units are not important for this discussion.) The measurements are given below: Car Trunk: ## [1] 67.9 68.9 69.5 67.6 73.4 64.5 73.0 59.7 66.9 68.2 71.8 64.8 56.3 Crime Scene: ## [1] 55.6 65.6 68.0 68.9 67.7 66.5 66.8 60.3 68.0 71.6 61.4 63.2 68.2 64.1 64.8 To construct the box plot, we start by finding the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for each of our data sets. Recall that the 25th percentile is the quantity such that 25% of the data values are less than this quantity, and similarly for the other percentiles. The percentiles for each of our data sets are shown in Table 10.1. Table 10.1: Percentiles Percentile Car Trunk Crime Scene \\(25^{th}\\) 64.8 63.65 \\(50^{th}\\) 67.9 66.50 \\(75^{th}\\) 69.5 68.00 Figure 10.1 shows how these percentiles are incorporated into box plots. The lower and upper limits of the box (called hinges) extend from the 25th to 75th percentile and a line between those at the 50th percentile (which is the median). Figure 10.1: Box Plots of Glass Measurements Comparing box plots, we see that the percentiles for the car trunk data are somewhat greater than for the crime scene data but there is considerable overlap between them. Based on this, it is difficult to say whether the glass pieces from car trunk and crime scene are from the same original source or different sources. Most box plots have more information than that shown in Figure 10.1 and there are a wide variety of options that can be included. We give a few examples below to provide a sense of what is possible but these are by no means comprehensive. We next add whiskers above and below each box to give additional information about the spread of the data. Whiskers are vertical lines that (optionally) end in a horizontal stroke. Define the step to be 1.5 times the IQR = 75th percentile - 25th percentile (IQR = Interquartile range). The upper whisker extends from the upper hinge to the greatest data value that is less than one step above the upper hinge, with the lower whisker similarly defined. (Software automates the process so one need not do this by hand.) Figure 10.2 shows the box plots with whiskers. Figure 10.2: Box Plots of Glass Measurements The whiskers add additional information about the spread of data, but do not extend to all values. We indicate these with dots that are beyond the whiskers in positions corresponding to data values. This is shown in Figure 10.3. Figure 10.3: Box Plots of Glass Measurements Some (but not all!) box plots also include a mark indicating the location of the mean. This is added in Figure 10.4 as a red dot in each box plot. Figure 10.4: Box Plots of Glass Measurements Figure 10.4 provides a good summary of the data. Half of the scores in a distribution are between the hinges (recall that the hinges are the 25th and 75th percentiles), we see that half the measurements for the glass from the car trunk are between about 65 and 69, while the measurements from the crime scene are between about 63.5 and 68. The IQR for each is about the same but the overall range for the car trunk measurements is somewhat greater then the crime scene measurements. For both data sets the mean is less than the median, which is to be expected due to the extreme small values displayed in Figure 10.4. 10.2 Variations on box plots Statistical analysis programs typically offer numerous options for creating box plots. For instance, Figure 10.5 shows the box plots as above but also includes the individual measurements along the vertical axis. (The means are still red to distinguish it from the data values.) This provides more detail on our data  note the points that specify the ends of the whiskers as well as the difference in how the points are distributed within the boxes. Figure 10.5: Box Plots of Glass Measurements Showing the specific data values on the vertical axis works well as long as there are not too many points and they do not tend to stack on top of each other. In the case of more points and more repetition of values, an option that can work is jittering which adds a horizontal offset so that points can be distinguished. Figure 10.6 shows our data with a modest amount of jitter added. Figure 10.6: Box Plots of Glass Measurements Different styles of box plots are best for different situations, and there are no firm rules for which to use. When exploring your data, you should try several ways of visualizing them. Which graphs you include in your report should depend on how well different graphs reveal the aspects of the data you consider most important. 10.3 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) 10.4 Code Appendix data01 &lt;- c(55.6, 65.6, 68.0, 68.9, 67.7, 66.5, 66.8, 60.3, 68.0, 71.6, 61.4, 63.2, 68.2, 64.1, 64.8) data02 &lt;- c(67.9, 68.9, 69.5, 67.6, 73.4, 64.5, 73.0, 59.7, 66.9, 68.2, 71.8, 64.8, 56.3) data01 &lt;- data.frame(Measurement = data01, Source = &quot;Crime Scene&quot;) data02 &lt;- data.frame(Measurement = data02, Source = &quot;Car Trunk&quot;) data03 &lt;- rbind(data01, data02) # Figure 9.1 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, coef = 0) # Figure 9.2 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) # Figure 9.3 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot() # Figure 9.4 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 2) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2) # Figure 9.5 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0, alpha = 0.9) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2) # Figure 9.6 ----- data03 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = Measurement)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.9) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &quot;point&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2) "],["graphing-distributions-bar-charts.html", "Chapter 11 Graphing Distributions: Bar Charts 11.1 Exercises 11.2 Code Appendix", " Chapter 11 Graphing Distributions: Bar Charts Note: Portions below modeled after content from Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University In the section on qualitative variables, we saw how bar charts can be used to illustrate the frequencies (or relative frequencies) of different categories. For example, the bar chart shown in Figure 11.1 depicts the percentage of people in a population that have each of the four possible ABO blood groups. Figure 11.1: Percentages for ABO Blood Groups In this chapter we consider how bar charts can be used to present other types of quantitative information. The bar chart in Figure 11.2 presents the number of murders in four large U.S. cities. Figure 11.2: Number of murders, selected U.S. cities, year 2000 A case can be made that more relevant than the total number of murders is the per capita number of murders. Figure 11.3 gives the number of murders per 1,000,000 population for the same cities. Figure 11.3: Murders per 1,000,000 residents, selected U.S. cities, year 2000 Bar charts can be useful for showing change over time. Figure 11.4, shows the year-to-year percent change in the number of shootings in the city of Toronto. The considerable variation from one year to the next is clear. Note also that negative percentages are possible, the result of the number of shootings decreasing from one year to the next. Figure 11.4: Year-to-year Percent Change, Shootings in Toronto Bar charts are often used to compare the means of different experimental conditions. Figure 11.5 shows the mean trace element measurement for collections of glass pieces found at a crime scene and in the car trunk of a suspect. (This data is treated more thoroughly in the chapter on box plots.) Figure 11.5: Comparison of mean trace element measurements The heights of the bars are very similar, suggesting that there might be a common source for the two sets of glass pieces. That might well be the case but the means alone are not enough to provide a conclusion one way or the other. In this case, box plots can be used instead since they provide more information about the distribution. Figure 11.6 shows the box plots for this data again. Figure 11.6: Box plots of glass measurements The box plots have considerable overlap, but at the same time the middle 50% of values from the car trunk seem to trend higher than those from the crime scene. This suggests the possibility of different sources for the two sets of glass pieces while not ruling out the possibility of them coming from the same source. We will consider this question more in later chapters. 11.1 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) 11.2 Code Appendix # Figure 10.1 ----- data &lt;- data.frame(ABO_Group = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;O&quot;), value = c(210, 45, 15, 230)) %&gt;% mutate(prop = value / sum(value) * 100) ggplot(data, aes(ABO_Group, prop)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, width = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;ABO Group&quot;, y = &quot;Percentage&quot;) # Figure 10.2 ----- data &lt;- data.frame(City = c(&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;), Murders = c(774, 251, 349, 468)) ggplot(data, aes(City, Murders)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, width = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;City&quot;, y = &quot;Murders&quot;) # Figure 10.3 ----- data &lt;- data.frame(City = c(&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;), Murders = c(281.8645, 192.4847, 89.51013, 53.15766)) ggplot(data, aes(City, Murders)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, width = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;City&quot;, y = &quot;Murders per 1,000,000 residents&quot;) # Figure 10.4 ----- data &lt;- data.frame(City = c(&quot;1995&quot;, &quot;1996&quot;, &quot;1997&quot;, &quot;1998&quot;, &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;), RateChange = c(62.7, 41.3, -2.9, 7.3, 16.7, -6.7)) # 2014-2020: 177, 288, 407, 395, 424, 495, 462 Shootings in Toronto (Wikipedia) ggplot(data, aes(City, RateChange)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, width = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Year-to-year Percent Change, Shootings&quot;) # Figure 10.5 ----- data01 = c(55.6, 65.6, 68.0, 68.9, 67.7, 66.5, 66.8, 60.3, 68.0, 71.6, 61.4, 63.2, 68.2, 64.1, 64.8) data02 = c(67.9, 68.9, 69.5, 67.6, 73.4, 64.5, 73.0, 59.7, 66.9, 68.2, 71.8, 64.8, 56.3) data &lt;- data.frame(Source = c(&quot;Car Trunk&quot;, &quot;Crime Scene&quot;), Mean = c(mean(data02), mean(data01))) ggplot(data, aes(Source, Mean)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, width = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;Source&quot;, y = &quot;Mean trace element measurement&quot;) # Figure 10.6 ----- data01 &lt;- data.frame(Measurement = data01, Source = &quot;Crime Scene&quot;) data02 &lt;- data.frame(Measurement = data02, Source = &quot;Car Trunk&quot;) data03 = rbind(data01, data02) ggplot(data03, aes(x=Source, y=Measurement, color=Source)) + stat_boxplot(geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) "],["sumarizing-distributions-central-tendency.html", "Chapter 12 Sumarizing Distributions: Central Tendency 12.1 Exercises", " Chapter 12 Sumarizing Distributions: Central Tendency Note: Portions below draw on content from Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University What is central tendency, and why do we want to know the central tendency of a group of scores? Let us first try to answer these questions intuitively. Then we will proceed to a more formal discussion. \\(\\Sigma_{n=1}\\) Imagine this situation: You are in a class with just four other students, and the five of you took a 5-point pop quiz. Today your instructor is walking around the room, handing back the quizzes. She stops at your desk and hands you your paper. Written in bold black ink on the front is 3/5. How do you react? Are you happy with your score of 3 or disappointed? How do you decide? You might calculate your percentage correct, realize it is 60%, and be appalled. But it is more likely that when deciding how to react to your performance, you will want additional information. What additional information would you like? If you are like most students, you will immediately ask your neighbors, Whadja get? and then ask the instructor, How did the class do? In other words, the additional information you want is how your quiz score compares to other students scores. You therefore understand the importance of comparing your score to the class distribution of scores. Should your score of 3 turn out to be among the higher scores, then youll be pleased after all. On the other hand, if 3 is among the lower scores in the class, you wont be quite so happy. This idea of comparing individual scores to a distribution of scores is fundamental to statistics. So lets explore it further, using the same example (the pop quiz you took with your four classmates). Three possible outcomes are shown in Table 1. They are labeled Dataset A, Dataset B, and Dataset C. Which of the three datasets would make you happiest? In other words, in comparing your score with your fellow students scores, in which dataset would your score of 3 be the most impressive? In Dataset A, everyones score is 3. This puts your score at the exact center of the distribution. You can draw satisfaction from the fact that you did as well as everyone else. But of course it cuts both ways: everyone else did just as well as you. Table 1. Three possible datasets for the 5-point make-up quiz. Student Dataset A Dataset B Dataset C You 3 3 3 Johns 3 4 2 Marias 3 4 2 Shareecias 3 4 2 Luthers 3 5 1 Now consider the possibility that the scores are described as in Dataset B. This is a depressing outcome even though your score is no different than the one in Dataset A. The problem is that the other four students had higher grades, putting yours below the center of the distribution. Finally, lets look at Dataset C. This is more like it! All of your classmates score lower than you so your score is above the center of the distribution. Now lets change the example in order to develop more insight into the center of a distribution. Figure 1 shows the results of an experiment on memory for chess positions. Subjects were shown a chess position and then asked to reconstruct it on an empty chess board. The number of pieces correctly placed was recorded. This was repeated for two more chess positions. The scores represent the total number of chess pieces correctly placed for the three chess positions. The maximum possible score was 89. Two groups are compared. On the left are people who dont play chess. On the right are people who play a great deal (tournament players). It is clear that the location of the center of the distribution for the non-players is much lower than the center of the distribution for the tournament players. Figure 1. Back-to-back stem and leaf display. The left side shows the memory scores of the non-players. The right side shows the scores of the tournament players. Were sure you get the idea now about the center of a distribution. It is time to move beyond intuition. We need a formal definition of the center of a distribution. In fact, well offer you three definitions! This is not just generosity on our part. There turn out to be (at least) three different ways of thinking about the center of a distribution, all of them useful in various contexts. In the remainder of this section we attempt to communicate the idea behind each concept. In the succeeding sections we will give statistical measures for these concepts of central tendency. Definitions of Center Now we explain the three different ways of defining the center of a distribution. All three are called measures of central tendency. Balance Scale One definition of central tendency is the point at which the distribution is in balance. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16 placed upon a balance scale. If each number weighs one pound, and is placed at its position along the number line, then it would be possible to balance them by placing a fulcrum at 6.8. Figure 2. A balance scale. For another example, consider the distribution shown in Figure 3. It is balanced by placing the fulcrum in the geometric middle. Figure 3. A distribution balanced on the tip of a triangle. Figure 4 illustrates that the same distribution cant be balanced by placing the fulcrum to the left of center. Figure 4. The distribution is not balanced. Figure 5 shows an asymmetric distribution. To balance it, we cannot put the fulcrum halfway between the lowest and highest values (as we did in Figure 3). Placing the fulcrum at the half way point would cause it to tip towards the left. Figure 5. An asymmetric distribution balanced on the tip of a triangle. The balance point defines one sense of a distributions center. The simulation in the next section Balance Scale Simulation shows how to find the point at which the distribution balances. Smallest Absolute Deviation Another way to define the center of a distribution is based on the concept of the sum of the absolute deviations (differences). Consider the distribution made up of the five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16. Lets see how far the distribution is from 10 (picking a number arbitrarily). Table 2 shows the sum of the absolute deviations of these numbers from the number 10. Table 2. An example of the sum of absolute deviations Values Absolute Deviations from 10 2 3 4 9 16 8 7 6 1 6 Sum 28 The first row of the table shows that the absolute value of the difference between 2 and 10 is 8; the second row shows that the absolute difference between 3 and 10 is 7, and similarly for the other rows. When we add up the five absolute deviations, we get 28. So, the sum of the absolute deviations from 10 is 28. Likewise, the sum of the absolute deviations from 5 equals 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 11 = 21. So, the sum of the absolute deviations from 5 is smaller than the sum of the absolute deviations from 10. In this sense, 5 is closer, overall, to the other numbers than is 10. We are now in a position to define a second measure of central tendency, this time in terms of absolute deviations. Specifically, according to our second definition, the center of a distribution is the number for which the sum of the absolute deviations is smallest. As we just saw, the sum of the absolute deviations from 10 is 28 and the sum of the absolute deviations from 5 is 21. Is there a value for which the sum of the absolute deviations is even smaller than 21? Yes. For these data, there is a value for which the sum of absolute deviations is only 20. See if you can find it. A general method for finding the center of a distribution in the sense of absolute deviations is provided in the simulation Absolute Differences Simulation. Smallest Squared Deviation We shall discuss one more way to define the center of a distribution. It is based on the concept of the sum of squared deviations (differences). Again, consider the distribution of the five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16. Table 3 shows the sum of the squared deviations of these numbers from the number 10. Table 3. An example of the sum of squared deviations. Values Squared Deviations from 10 2 3 4 9 16 64 49 36 1 36 Sum 186 The first row in the table shows that the squared value of the difference between 2 and 10 is 64; the second row shows that the squared difference between 3 and 10 is 49, and so forth. When we add up all these squared deviations, we get 186. Changing the target from 10 to 5, we calculate the sum of the squared deviations from 5 as 9 + 4 + 1 + 16 + 121 = 151. So, the sum of the squared deviations from 5 is smaller than the sum of the squared deviations from 10. Is there a value for which the sum of the squared deviations is even smaller than 151? Yes, it is possible to reach 134.8. Can you find the target number for which the sum of squared deviations is 134.8? The target that minimizes the sum of squared deviations provides another useful definition of central tendency (the last one to be discussed in this section). It can be challenging to find the value that minimizes this sum. You will see how you do it in the upcoming section Squared Differences Simulation. 12.1 Exercises \\(\\text{Put exercises here}\\) "],["sumarizing-distributions-measures-of-central-tendency.html", "Chapter 13 Sumarizing Distributions: Measures of Central Tendency 13.1 Exercises", " Chapter 13 Sumarizing Distributions: Measures of Central Tendency Note: Portions below modeled after content from Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/) Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University In the previous section we saw that there are several ways to define central tendency. This section defines the three most common measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode. The relationships among these measures of central tendency and the definitions given in the previous section will probably not be obvious to you. Rather than just tell you these relationships, we will allow you to discover them in the simulations in the sections that follow. This section gives only the basic definitions of the mean, median and mode. A further discussion of the relative merits and proper applications of these statistics is presented in a later section. Arithmetic Mean The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It is simply the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. The symbol  is used for the mean of a population. The symbol M is used for the mean of a sample. The formula for  is shown below:  = X/N where X is the sum of all the numbers in the population and N is the number of numbers in the population. The formula for M is essentially identical: M = X/N where X is the sum of all the numbers in the sample and N is the number of numbers in the sample. As an example, the mean of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 is 20/5 = 4 regardless of whether the numbers constitute the entire population or just a sample from the population. Table 1 shows the number of touchdown (TD) passes thrown by each of the 31 teams in the National Football League in the 2000 season. The mean number of touchdown passes thrown is 20.4516 as shown below.  = X/N = 634/31 = 20.4516 Table 1. Number of touchdown passes. 37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20 20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6 Although the arithmetic mean is not the only mean (there is also a geometric mean), it is by far the most commonly used. Therefore, if the term mean is used without specifying whether it is the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, or some other mean, it is assumed to refer to the arithmetic mean. Median The median is also a frequently used measure of central tendency. The median is the midpoint of a distribution: the same number of scores is above the median as below it. For the data in Table 1, there are 31 scores. The 16th highest score (which equals 20) is the median because there are 15 scores below the 16th score and 15 scores above the 16th score. The median can also be thought of as the 50th percentile. Computation of the Median When there is an odd number of numbers, the median is simply the middle number. For example, the median of 2, 4, and 7 is 4. When there is an even number of numbers, the median is the mean of the two middle numbers. Thus, the median of the numbers 2, 4, 7, 12 is (4+7)/2 = 5.5. When there are numbers with the same values, then the formula for the third definition of the 50th percentile should be used. Mode The mode is the most frequently occurring value. For the data in Table 1, the mode is 18 since more teams (4) had 18 touchdown passes than any other number of touchdown passes. With continuous data such as response time measured to many decimals, the frequency of each value is one since no two scores will be exactly the same (see discussion of continuous variables). Therefore the mode of continuous data is normally computed from a grouped frequency distribution. Table 2 shows a grouped frequency distribution for the target response time data. Since the interval with the highest frequency is 600-700, the mode is the middle of that interval (650). Table 2. Grouped frequency distribution.
