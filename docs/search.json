Lane, Rice University previous section saw several ways define central tendency. section defines three common measures central tendency: mean, median, mode. relationships among measures central tendency definitions given previous section probably obvious . Rather just tell relationships, allow discover simulations sections follow.section gives basic definitions mean, median mode. discussion relative merits proper applications statistics presented later section.Arithmetic MeanThe arithmetic mean common measure central tendency. simply sum numbers divided number numbers. symbol “μ” used mean population. symbol “M” used mean sample. formula μ shown :μ = ΣX/N\nΣX sum numbers population \nN number numbers population.formula M essentially identical:M = ΣX/N\nΣX sum numbers sample \nN number numbers sample.example, mean numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 20/5 = 4 regardless whether numbers constitute entire population just sample population.Table 1 shows number touchdown (TD) passes thrown 31 teams National Football League 2000 season. mean number touchdown passes thrown 20.4516 shown .μ = ΣX/N\n= 634/31\n= 20.4516\nTable 1.

Therefore, term “mean” used without specifying whether arithmetic mean, geometric mean, mean, assumed refer arithmetic mean.MedianThe median also frequently used measure central tendency. median midpoint distribution: number scores median . data Table 1, 31 scores. 16th highest score (equals 20) median 15 scores 16th score 15 scores 16th score. median can also thought 50th percentile.Computation MedianWhen odd number numbers, median simply middle number. example, median 2, 4, 7 4. even number numbers, median mean two middle numbers. Thus, median numbers 2, 4, 7, 12 (4+7)/2 = 5.5. numbers values, formula third definition 50th percentile used.ModeThe mode frequently occurring value. data Table 1, mode 18 since teams (4) 18 touchdown passes number touchdown passes. continuous data response time measured many decimals, frequency value one since two scores exactly (see discussion continuous variables). Therefore mode continuous data normally computed grouped frequency distribution. Table 2 shows grouped frequency distribution target response time data. Since interval highest frequency 600-700, mode middle interval (650).Table 2.
