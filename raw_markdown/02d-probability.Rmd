# Probability Rules


Earlier we computed the conditional probability

$$
\mbox{P(Type O | Female)} = \frac{202}{430} 
$$

The numerator 202 came from the count of Females who have blood Type B, 
and the denominator 430 is the total number of Females.  If we divide the numerator and denominator by 1000, then the quotient is not changed, so that

$$
\mbox{P(Type O | Female)} = \frac{202/1000}{430/1000} 
= \frac{0.202}{0.43} = \frac{\mbox{P(Type O and Female)}}{\mbox{P(Female)}}
$$

This illustrates a general property of probability: If A and B 
represent possible outcomes, then the probability of A given B is

$$
\mbox{P(A | B)} = \frac{\mbox{P(A and B)}}{\mbox{P(B)}}
$$

Multiplying on both sides of the above equation by P(B) gives

$$
\mbox{P(A and B)} = \mbox{P(A | B)}\mbox{P(B)}  
$$

This is called the **multiplication rule**.  
Reversing the order of A and B above gives

$$
\mbox{P(B and A)} = \mbox{P(B | A)}\mbox{P(A)}  
$$

In the blood type example, it is clear that P(Female and Type O)
is the same as P(Type O and Female).  This is true in general:
P(A and B) = P(B and A)}, it follows that
\[
\mbox{Pr(A $|$ B)}\mbox{Pr(B)}  = \mbox{Pr(B $|$ A)}\mbox{Pr(A)} 
\]
so that 
\[
\mbox{Pr(A $|$ B)}  = \mbox{Pr(B $|$ A)}\frac{\mbox{Pr(A)}}{\mbox{Pr(B)}}
\]
This formula is called \textbf{Bayes Rule}.  Applied to our earlier population, we have
\[
\mbox{Pr(Type O $|$ Female)} = \mbox{Pr(Female $|$ Type O)}\frac{\mbox{Pr(Type O)}}{\mbox{Pr(Female)}}
\]



Two outcomes A and B are \textbf{independent} when
$\mbox{Pr(A $|$ B)} = \mbox{Pr(A)}$, which implies that knowing if B has
occurred has no effect on the
probability of A.
