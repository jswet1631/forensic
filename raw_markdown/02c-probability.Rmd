# Conditional Probability

Now suppose that we just focus on the females in the population, which forms a subset of the population. 
The probability that a randomly selected female has blood type O is an example of a **conditional probability**.  

There are 430 females in the population, and 202 of those have type O blood. 
Hence, the probability that female chosen at random has type O blood is

$$
\mbox{P(Type O | Female)} = \frac{202}{430} = 0.470
$$

The vertical bar in the notation is interpreted as *given that*, so that $\mbox{P(Type O | Female)}$ is read as 

$$
\mbox{The probability of blood type O, given the person is female.}
$$

Conditional probabilities arise all the time when evaluating forensic evidence. Other examples of conditional probabilities:

The probability of Type AB, given that the person is male:

$$
\mbox{P(Type AB | Male)} = \frac{24}{570} = 0.042
$$

The probability the person is female, given Type B blood:

$$
\mbox{P(Female | Type B)} = \frac{37}{100} = 0.37
$$

The probability the person is male, given Type A blood:

$$
\mbox{P(Male | Type A)} = \frac{235}{410} = 0.573
$$
