# Bayes Rule

## Restricting the Population

Reversing the order of X and Y above gives

$$
\mbox{P(Y and X)} = \mbox{P(Y | X)}\mbox{P(A)}  
$$

In the blood type example, it is clear that P(Female and Type O) is the same as P(Type O and Female). 
This is true in general: P(A and B) = P(B and A), it follows that
$$
\mbox{Pr(A | B)}\mbox{Pr(B)}  = \mbox{Pr(B | A)}\mbox{Pr(A)} 
$$
so that 
$$
\mbox{Pr(A | B)}  = \mbox{Pr(B | A)}\frac{\mbox{Pr(A)}}{\mbox{Pr(B)}}
$$
This formula is called $\textbf{Bayes Rule}$. Applied to our earlier population, we have
$$
\mbox{Pr(Type O | Female)} = \mbox{Pr(Female | Type O)}\frac{\mbox{Pr(Type O)}}{\mbox{Pr(Female)}}
$$

Two outcomes A and B are $\textbf{independent}$ when $\mbox{Pr(A | B)} = \mbox{Pr(A)}$, 
which implies that knowing if B has occurred has no effect on the probability of A.
