## Introduction

Suppose that we have a community of 1000 people.  Each is classified based on 
their ABO blood group, which is one of A, B, AB, or O.  Below we consider
graphical methods for displaying the results of the blood group classifications.
This starts with tables, and then continues on to how to graph data that 
fall into a small number of categories. 

This is an example of *qualitative data*.  One characteristic of such data is
that the different values do not come with any pre-established ordering.
This can be contrasted with quantitative data, such as the weight of a bag of an 
unknown substance, which does have a natural ordering with respect to 
different weights.

## Frequency Tables

All of the graphical methods shown in this section are derived from frequency 
tables. Table 1 shows a frequency table for the results of the ABO blood group
classification.  It also shows the 
relative frequencies, which are the proportion classified in each category. 
For example, the relative frequency for group B is 90/1000 = 0.09.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline
\mathrm{ABO} & & \mathrm{Relative} \\
\mathrm{Group} & \mathrm{Frequency} & \mathrm{Frequency} \\ \hline
\mathrm{A} & 420 & 0.42  \\  \hline
\mathrm{B} & 90  & 0.09 \\  \hline
\mathrm{AB} & 30 & 0.03 \\  \hline
\mathrm{O} & 460 & 0.46 \\  \hline
\end{array}\\

## Pie Charts

The pie chart in Figure 1 shows the results of the iMac study. In a pie chart, 
each category is represented by a slice of the pie. The area of the slice is 
proportional to the percentage of responses in the category. This is simply the 
relative frequency multiplied by 100. Although most iMac purchasers were 
Macintosh owners, Apple was encouraged by the 12% of purchasers who were former 
Windows users, and by the 17% of purchasers who were buying a computer for the 
first time.

Pie charts are effective for displaying the relative frequencies of a small 
number of categories. They are not recommended, however, when you have a large 
number of categories. Pie charts can also be confusing when they are used to 
compare the outcomes of two different surveys or experiments. In an influential 
book on the use of graphs, Edward Tufte asserted, "The only worse design than 
a pie chart is several of them."

Here is another important point about pie charts. If they are based on a small 
number of observations, it can be misleading to label the pie slices with 
percentages. For example, if just 5 people had been interviewed by Apple 
Computers, and 3 were former Windows users, it would be misleading to display 
a pie chart with the Windows slice showing 60%. With so few people interviewed, 
such a large percentage of Windows users might easily have occurred since chance 
can cause large errors with small samples. In this case, it is better to alert 
the user of the pie chart to the actual numbers involved. The slices should 
therefore be labeled with the actual frequencies observed (e.g., 3) instead 
of with percentages.

## Bar Charts

Bar charts can also be used to represent frequencies of different categories. 
A bar chart of the iMac purchases is shown in Figure 2. Frequencies are shown 
on the Y-axis and the type of computer previously owned is shown on the X-axis. 
Typically, the Y-axis shows the number of observations in each category rather 
than the percentage of observations as is typical in pie charts.

## Comparing Distributions

Often we need to compare the results of different surveys, or of different 
conditions within the same overall survey. In this case, we are comparing the 
"distributions" of responses between the surveys or conditions. Bar charts are 
often excellent for illustrating differences between two distributions. 
Figure 3 shows the number of people playing card games at the Yahoo website on 
a Sunday and on a Wednesday in the Spring of 2001. We see that there were more 
players overall on Wednesday compared to Sunday. The number of people playing 
Pinochle was nonetheless the same on these two days. In contrast, there were 
about twice as many people playing hearts on Wednesday as on Sunday. Facts like 
these emerge clearly from a well-designed bar chart.

Sunday and Wednesday.

The bars in Figure 3 are oriented horizontally rather than vertically. The 
horizontal format is useful when you have many categories because there is more 
room for the category labels. Weâ€™ll have more to say about bar charts when we 
consider numerical quantities later in the section Bar Charts.
