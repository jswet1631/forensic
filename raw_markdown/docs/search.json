Figure 2 shows distribution five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16 placed upon balance scale. number weighs one pound, placed position along number line, possible balance placing fulcrum 6.8.Figure 2. balance scale.another example, consider distribution shown Figure 3. balanced placing fulcrum geometric middle.Figure 3. distribution balanced tip triangle.Figure 4 illustrates distribution can’t balanced placing fulcrum left center.Figure 4. distribution balanced.Figure 5 shows asymmetric distribution. balance , put fulcrum halfway lowest highest values (Figure 3). Placing fulcrum “half way” point cause tip towards left.Figure 5. asymmetric distribution balanced tip triangle.balance point defines one sense distribution’s center. simulation next section “Balance Scale Simulation” shows find point distribution balances.Smallest Absolute DeviationAnother way define center distribution based concept sum absolute deviations (differences). Consider distribution made five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16. Let’s see far distribution 10 (picking number arbitrarily). Table 2 shows sum absolute deviations numbers number 10.Table 2. example sum absolute deviationsValues Absolute Deviations 10\n2\n3\n4\n9\n16 8\n7\n6\n1\n6\nSum 28\nfirst row table shows absolute value difference 2 10 8; second row shows absolute difference 3 10 7, similarly rows. add five absolute deviations, get 28. , sum absolute deviations 10 28. Likewise, sum absolute deviations 5 equals 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 11 = 21. , sum absolute deviations 5 smaller sum absolute deviations 10. sense, 5 closer, overall, numbers 10.now position define second measure central tendency, time terms absolute deviations. Specifically, according second definition, center distribution number sum absolute deviations smallest. just saw, sum absolute deviations 10 28 sum absolute deviations 5 21. value sum absolute deviations even smaller 21? Yes. data, value sum absolute deviations 20. See can find . general method finding center distribution sense absolute deviations provided simulation “Absolute Differences Simulation.”Smallest Squared DeviationWe shall discuss one way define center distribution. based concept sum squared deviations (differences). , consider distribution five numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 16.

Lane, Rice University previous section saw several ways define central tendency. section defines three common measures central tendency: mean, median, mode. relationships among measures central tendency definitions given previous section probably obvious . Rather just tell relationships, allow discover simulations sections follow.section gives basic definitions mean, median mode. discussion relative merits proper applications statistics presented later section.Arithmetic MeanThe arithmetic mean common measure central tendency. simply sum numbers divided number numbers. symbol “μ” used mean population. symbol “M” used mean sample. formula μ shown :μ = ΣX/N\nΣX sum numbers population \nN number numbers population.formula M essentially identical:M = ΣX/N\nΣX sum numbers sample \nN number numbers sample.example, mean numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 20/5 = 4 regardless whether numbers constitute entire population just sample population.Table 1 shows number touchdown (TD) passes thrown 31 teams National Football League 2000 season. mean number touchdown passes thrown 20.4516 shown .μ = ΣX/N\n= 634/31\n= 20.4516\nTable 1.

Therefore, term “mean” used without specifying whether arithmetic mean, geometric mean, mean, assumed refer arithmetic mean.MedianThe median also frequently used measure central tendency. median midpoint distribution: number scores median . data Table 1, 31 scores. 16th highest score (equals 20) median 15 scores 16th score 15 scores 16th score. median can also thought 50th percentile.Computation MedianWhen odd number numbers, median simply middle number. example, median 2, 4, 7 4. even number numbers, median mean two middle numbers. Thus, median numbers 2, 4, 7, 12 (4+7)/2 = 5.5. numbers values, formula third definition 50th percentile used.ModeThe mode frequently occurring value. data Table 1, mode 18 since teams (4) 18 touchdown passes number touchdown passes. continuous data response time measured many decimals, frequency value one since two scores exactly (see discussion continuous variables). Therefore mode continuous data normally computed grouped frequency distribution. Table 2 shows grouped frequency distribution target response time data. Since interval highest frequency 600-700, mode middle interval (650).Table 2.
