## The Previous Example

The example from the previous section involves the "likelihood" of arresting the
correct person based on their hair color.  Here we begin the development of
"probability" which allows us to quantify the notion of likelihood.

Let's start by providing some additional context for our example: 
Suppose that the crime described takes place on an island of 1000 people. 
The number of these people with each hair color is given in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \mathrm{Color} & \mathrm{Count} \\ \hline
\mathrm{Brown} & 670  \\ 
\mathrm{Blond} & 200  \\ 
\mathrm{Red} & 110  \\ 
\mathrm{Green} & 20  \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Hair Color Counts}
$$

A **probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that provides a measure of the 
likelihood that something occurs, 
with a larger number indicating greater likelihood. 

Suppose that we select a person from this population at random. To compute 
the **probability** that this person has brown hair,
we take the number with brown hair and divide by the number of people:

$$\mbox{P(Brown hair)} = \frac{670}{1000} = 0.67$$

We use "P(...)" to denote the probability of something. For instance in this case
$\mbox{P(Brown hair)}$ = "probability of brown hair".  

### Sample Questions

Sprinkled thought this book are Sample Questions, which also play the role
of examples. In the online version, the
solutions to these questions are hidden.  Before looking at the solution 
(by hovering), we recommend that you try to do them yourself!

**1.** What is the probability that a randomly selected person has blond hair?

**Answer:** <hide>$P(\text{Blond}) = \frac{200}{1000} = 0.20$.<hide>

**2.** What is the probability that a randomly selected person has red hair?

**Answer:** <hide>$P(\text{Red}) = \frac{110}{1000} = 0.11$.<hide>



## Calculating Probabilities From Data

Let's suppose that the crime described above takes place on an island that has 1000 people. 
The number of people with each hair color is given in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \mathrm{Color} & \mathrm{Count} \\ \hline
\mathrm{Brown} & 670  \\ 
\mathrm{Blond} & 200  \\ 
\mathrm{Red} & 110  \\ 
\mathrm{Green} & 20  \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Hair Color Counts}
$$






In probability terminology, 
the thing occurring is called an *event*. 
In our question, the event is the police arresting the correct person.

Coming back to our question, we need to decide which version has the greater 
probability. In most communities, 
people with brown hair outnumber people with green hair -- let's assume that is the case here. 
Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that the probability of Version 2 is greater 
than that of Version 1: 
Brown-haired people are relatively common, so in Version 1 the probability of 
arresting the correct brown-haired person is low. 
On the other hand, green-haired people are fairly are, so in Version 2, 
the probability of arresting the correct person is higher.

Two important points:

1) Just because the probability of the correct arrest is greater in Version 2 
than in Version 1 does not mean that the probability in Version 2 is high.
It's possible that there are more brown-haired people than green-haired people 
while still having a lot of green-haird people, 
making both probabilities small. 

2) While the above discussion is interesting, it is important to have a better 
sense of the actual numerical value of the probability. 
We start in that direction in the next section.
