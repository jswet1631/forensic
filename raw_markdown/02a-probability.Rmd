## The Previous Example

The example from the previous section involves the "likelihood" of arresting the
correct person based on their hair color.  Here we begin the development of
"probability" which allows us to quantify the notion of likelihood.

Let's start by providing some additional context for our example: 
Suppose that the crime described takes place on an island of 1000 people. 
The number of these people with each hair color is given in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \mathrm{Color} & \mathrm{Count} \\ \hline
\mathrm{Brown} & 670  \\ 
\mathrm{Blond} & 200  \\ 
\mathrm{Red} & 110  \\ 
\mathrm{Green} & 20  \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Hair Color Counts}
$$

A **probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that provides a measure of the 
likelihood that something occurs, 
with a larger number indicating greater likelihood. 

Suppose that we select a person from this population at random. To compute 
the probability that this person has brown hair,
we take the number with brown hair and divide by the number of people:

$$\mbox{P(Brown hair)} = \frac{670}{1000} = 0.67$$

We use "P(...)" to denote the probability of something. For instance in this case
$\mbox{P(Brown hair)}$ = "probability of brown hair".  

### Sample Questions

Sprinkled thought this book are Sample Questions, which also play the role
of examples. In the online version, the
solutions to these questions are hidden.  Before looking at the solution 
(by hovering), we recommend that you try to do them yourself!

**1.** What is the probability that a randomly selected person has blond hair?

**Answer:** <hide>$P(\text{Blond}) = \frac{200}{1000} = 0.20$.<hide>

**2.** What is the probability that a randomly selected person has red hair?

**Answer:** <hide>$P(\text{Red}) = \frac{110}{1000} = 0.11$.<hide>

These examples are fine but do not answer the question from the previous section.
In Version 1, we have a brown-haired person on the CCTV and one of the
670 brown-haired people randomly arrested.
Thus the probability that the correct person is arrested is

$$\mbox{P(correct arrest)} = \frac{1}{670} = 0.00149$$

In Version 2 of the example we have a green-haired person on CCTV, so this 
time the probability that the correct person is arrested is

$$\mbox{P(correct arrest)} = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$

Dividing the two probabilities

$$\frac{0.05}{0.00149} = 33.5$$

we see that a correct arrest in Version 2 is 33.5 times as likely as in Version 1.
However, even in Version 2 there is only a 0.05 probability that the police have
the correct person!

### Sample Questions

**1.** Suppose CCTV shows a red-haired person committed the robbery, and that
a random red-haired person is arrested.  What is the probability of a correct
arrest in this instance?

**Answer:** <hide>$P(\text{correct arrest}) = \frac{1}{110} = 0.00909$.<hide>

**2.** Determine the number of times greater the likelihood of a correct arrest
if the culprit has red hair vs having blond hair.


**Answer:** <hide>In the case of a blond-hairded person, we have
$P(\text{correct arrest}) = \frac{1}{200} = 0.005$.  Therefore the ratio
of probabilities is

$$\frac{0.00909}{0.005} = 1.81818$$

so a correct arrest for a red-haired culprit is 1.81818 times as likely
as for a blond-haired culprit.

## Calculating Probabilities From Tables

In practice we often have information about probabilities instead of
population counts.  For example, in the case of our example instead of
the number of people with each hair color we have

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \mathrm{Color} & \mathrm{Probability} \\ \hline
\mathrm{Brown} & 0.67  \\ 
\mathrm{Blond} & 0.20  \\ 
\mathrm{Red} & 0.11  \\ 
\mathrm{Green} & 0.02  \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Hair Color Probabilities}
