# Introduction to Probability

## A Initial Example

We start this introduction to probability with an example that has been simplified in many ways:
Suppose that there is a late-night break-in at a closed convenience store.
No one is present to see the perpetrator, but there is low-quality CCTV footage. 
Unfortunately, the *only* thing that can be discerned from the video is the color of the perpetrator's hair.

Now consider two possible versions of what comes next:

**Version 1**: The video shows that the perpetrator has brown hair. 
The day after the robbery, police see a person with brown hair walking down the street. 
The person is arrested on suspicion of committing the break-in.

**Version 2**: The video shows that the perpetrator has green hair.  
The day after the robbery, police see a person with green hair walking down the street. 
The person is arrested on suspicion of committing the break-in.

For the sake of this simplified example, 
in both versions we assume that the color of the hair is the *only* reason the police suspect the person arrested.

**Question**: In which version do you think it is more likely that the police have arrested the person who committed the break-in?

Answering the question requires considering the likelihood that the police have the correct person in both versions and deciding which is greater.  

A **probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that provides a measure of the likelihood that something occurs, 
with a larger number indicating increased likelihood. In probability terminology, the thing occurring is called an *event*. 
In our question, the event is the police arresting the correct person.

Coming back to our question, we need to decide which version has the greater probability. In most communities, 
people with brown hair outnumber people with green hair -- let's assume that is the case here. 
Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that the probability of Version 2 is greater than that of Version 1: 
Brown-haired people are relatively common, so in Version 1 the probability of arresting the correct brown-haired person is low. 
On the other hand, green-haired people are rare, so in Version 2, the probability of arresting the correct person is higher.

Two important points:

1) Just because the probability of the correct arrest is greater in Version 2 than in Version 1 does not mean that the probability in Version 2 is high.
It's possible that there are more brown-haired people than green-haired people while still having a lot of green-haird people, 
making both probabilities small. (Consider if we replace "green" with "blond".)

2) While the above discussion is interesting, it is important to have a better sense of the actual value of the probability. 
We start in that direction in the next section.

## Calculating Probabilities From Data

Let's suppose that the crime described above takes place on an island that has 1000 people. 
The number of people with each hair color is given in the table below.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \mathrm{Color} & \mathrm{Count} \\ \hline
\mathrm{Brown} & 670  \\ 
\mathrm{Blond} & 180  \\ 
\mathrm{Red} & 110  \\ 
\mathrm{Green} & 40  \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Hair Color Counts}
$$

Now suppose that we select a person from this population at random. To compute the **probability** that this person has brown hair,
we take the number with brown hair and divide by the number of people:

$$\mbox{P(Brown hair)} = \frac{670}{1000} = 0.67$$

$$\mbox{This space will get examples and a probability table}$$
