# Joint Probability

## Blood Types

Blood plays a role in many forensic science applications, with the "blood
type" determined by a combination of two different blood group systems:

> *Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. 
As of 2019, a total of 41 human blood group systems are recognized by the 
International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The two most 
important blood group systems are ABO and Rh; they determine someone's 
blood type (A, B, AB, and O, with +, âˆ’ or null denoting RhD status) 
for suitability in blood transfusion.*^[Blood type - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type]

<!-- ![Source: https://www.blood.ca/en/blood/donating-blood/whats-my-blood-type](images/BloodType-PieGraph_0.jpg) -->

Suppose that we have a collection of 1000 people, with each classified based on both
ABO (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh ($+$ or $-$). 
The number of people of each combination of ABO and Rh class (the "blood type") is shown 
in the table below. ^[This table is based on the distribution of blood types in Canada, reported at https://www.blood.ca/en/blood/donating-blood/whats-my-blood-type]

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
       & + & - \\ \hline
\mathrm{A} & 360 & 60 \\ 
\mathrm{B} & 76 & 14 \\ 
\mathrm{AB} & 25 & 5 \\ 
\mathrm{O} & 390 & 70 \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 1: Frequencies by ABO and Rh groups}
$$

Suppose that one of these people is selected at random and note that person's groups. 
There are various possibilities for outcomes, such as the person selected has 
ABO group O and Rh group $+$.
The likelihood that this combination occurs is the **joint probability** of the two classifications,
ABO and Rh groupings.
There are 390 out of the 1000 people are O and $+$, so the probability of randomly 
selecting such a person is

$$\text{P(O and +)} = \frac{390}{1000} = 0.39$$

Here P(O and $+$) stands for the probability that the person selected is 
ABO group O **and** Rh group $+$. 
A sample of other probabilities that come from the table are

$$\begin{array}{rcccl}
\text{P(AB and }-) & = & {\displaystyle\frac{5}{1000}} & = & 0.005 \\[5pt]
\text{P(B and +)} & = & {\displaystyle\frac{76}{1000}} & = & 0.076 \\[5pt]
\text{P(B and }-) & = & {\displaystyle\frac{14}{1000}} & = & 0.014 \\
\end{array}$$

We also can combine table entries to compute other probabilities. 
For instance, there are a total of $76 + 14 = 90$ people with blood group B,
so the probability of randomly selecting a person with blood group B is

$$
\mbox{P(B)} = \frac{76+14}{1000} = \frac{90}{1000} = 0.09
$$

As another example, the number of people with
Rh group $+$ is $360 + 76 + 25 + 390 = 851$.  Thus the probability of randomly selecting
a person with Rh group $+$ is

$$
\mbox{P(+)} = \frac{360 + 76 + 25 + 390}{1000} = \frac{851}{1000} = 0.851
$$

**3.** Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group A and
ABO group B and Rh group $+$.

**Answer:** <hide>The is no person that has ABO group A *and* ABO group B, so 
$P(\text{A and O and +}) = \frac{0}{1000} = 0$. <hide>

## And vs Or

Above we saw that $\text{P(B and }+) = 0.076$. Suppose we instead would like 
to know $\text{P(B or }+)$? 
That is, we want to know the probability that a randomly selected person 
is either ABO group B **or** Rh group $+$. 
Note that this includes those people who are both ABO group B **and** Rh group $+$.

From our table we see that the total number of people satisfying one or both
conditions is $360 + 76 + 24 + 390 + 14 = 864$ so that

$$
\underbrace{(14)}_\text{ABO group B} \hspace{-.15in}+ \hspace{.05in}\underbrace{(360 + 25 + 390)}_\text{Rh group +} 
+ \underbrace{(76)}_\text{Both}= 864
$$
The corresponding probability is 

$$
\text{P(B or +)} = \frac{864}{1000} = 0.864
$$

Other combinations are possible. 
For instance, the number of people with ABO group A blood or ABO group B blood
is
$$
\underbrace{(360 + 60)}_\text{ABO group A} + \underbrace{(76 + 14)}_\text{ABO group B} = 510
$$

Therefore we have

$$
\mbox{P(A or B)} = \frac{510}{1000} = 0.51
$$

### Sample Questions

**1.** Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group AB
or Rh group $-$ blood.

**Answer:** <hide>The number of people who have ABO group AB **or** Rh group $-$ is
$25 + 5 + 60 + 14 + 70 = 174$ so that 
$\text{P(AB or }-) = \frac{174}{1000} = 0.174$<hide>

**2.** Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group O
or Rh group $+$ blood.

**Answer:** <hide>The number of people who have ABO group O **or** Rh group $+$ is
$390 + 70 + 360 + 76 + 25 = 921$ so that 
$\text{P(O or }+) = \frac{921}{1000} = 0.921$<hide>

**3.** Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group AB or O.

**Answer:** <hide>The number of people who have ABO group AB **or** ABO group O is
$25 + 5 + 390 + 70 = 490$ so that 
$\text{P(AB or O)} = \frac{490}{1000} = 0.49$<hide>

**4.** Find the probability that a randomly selected person has ABO group A or AB,
and also Rh group $-$.

**Answer:** <hide> 
We have $\text{(A or AB) and }(-) = (\text{A and }-) \text{ or } (\text{AB and }-)$.
The number of people who are $(\text{A and }-)$ is 60, and the number of
people who are $(\text{AB and }-)$ is 5, so that
$P(\text{(A or AB) and }(-)) = \frac{60+5}{1000} = 0.065$.

## Probability Tables

Frequently, tables provide probabilities (or percentages) instead of counts. 
To make the conversion from counts to probabilities, 
all we do is divide each table entry by the total. 
Thus for our table of blood type counts above, 
we divide each entry by 1000 to arrive at Table 2.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
       & + & - \\ \hline
\mathrm{A} & 0.360 & 0.060 \\ 
\mathrm{B} & 0.076 & 0.014 \\ 
\mathrm{AB} & 0.025 & 0.005 \\ 
\mathrm{O} & 0.390 & 0.070 \\ 
\end{array}\\
\mbox{Table 2: Probabilities by ABO and Rh groups}
$$

Table 2 entries give the probability of selecting each blood type
(determined by the combination of ABO and Rh).  For instance

$$
\mbox{P(AB}-) = 0.014
$$

We can add entries in Table 2 to compute other probabilities.  
For example, suppose we want to compute the probability that a randomly 
selected person has ABO group O blood. 
Based on the table, this can happen if a person is either O$+$ or O$-$. 
Because these two groups are disjoint, we can add the probabilities to arrive at

$$
\mbox{P(O}) = \mbox{P(O}+) + \mbox{P(O}-)
= 0.390 + 0.070 = 0.460
$$

If instead (for instance) we want to compute P($+$) then we add the entries in 
the corresponding column, giving us

$$
\mbox{Pr(+}) = 0.360 + 0.076 + 0.025 + 0.390 = 0.851 
$$

Note that this matches what we saw earlier.
