**This is a draft version of a work in progress. It is NOT intended for circulation.**

This book introduces statistical methods that are of use in forensic science. In some cases the methods are currently used,
in others the methods are described but not generally in use, although they could be!  

We assume that the reader has a basic understanding of mathematics, but no prior knowledge of statistics is required.
We will provide a modest description of forensic science methods, but as many of these are highly nuanced we do not attempt to 
provide a deep treatment of them here. However, when possible we will try to provide references to more information.

There are portions of this book that borrow from the treatment of probability and statistics given in the online materials:

Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study (http://onlinestatbook.com/). Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University.

This site provides a comprehensive introduction to probability and statistics, and is worth referencing when you would like additional information. 
We appreciate their willingness to allow the use of their work.
